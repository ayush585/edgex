## 🧠 Issue Difficulty Levels

To help contributors of all experience levels get involved, we label issues based on their complexity:

| 🔖 **Label** | 👤 **Best For** | 🛠️ **Typical Tasks** |
|--------------|------------------|------------------------|
| `easy` | 🟢 Beginners | Simple UI fixes, adding buttons, correcting typos, updating static content |
| `medium` | 🟡 Intermediate developers | Creating new components, implementing state logic, handling API data |
| `hard` | 🔴 Experienced contributors | Designing backend logic, integrating new features, performance tuning, advanced debugging |

> 💡 **Tip:**  
> If you're new to open source or this project, start with issues labeled `easy` or `good first issue`. These are specially curated to help you get started smoothly!

### 🚀 Getting Started with Issues

We recommend the following workflow for choosing and working on issues:

1. **Browse Open Issues**  
  
2. **Find an Issue That Matches Your Skills**  
   Start small, especially if this is your first contribution. Don't hesitate to grow from `easy` to `medium` and beyond!

3. **Ask to Be Assigned**  
   Leave a comment on the issue (e.g., _"I'd like to work on this issue"_) and wait for a maintainer to assign it to you.

4. **Wait for Approval**  
   Before diving in, please wait for confirmation. Sometimes someone else is already working on the issue or maintainers might suggest changes in approach.
